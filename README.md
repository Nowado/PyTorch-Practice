# PyTorch-Practice

Straight forward practice (clearly following guides) for using PyTorch. Simple image recognition with just as simple notes on architecture/hyperparameters tuning. I noticed more 'PyTorch' in job requirements lately, so I figured I might as well upload my practice jupyters here. 

KannadaMNIST uses https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST/data dataset. After changing data source runs just fine on Kaggle notebooks.
